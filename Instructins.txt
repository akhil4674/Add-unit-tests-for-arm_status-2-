We should have unit tests verifying that different joint values produce the correct results:

 When the arm's joint values are at the stowed position, the arm's stowed evaluation should report that correctly
 When the arm's joint values are not at the stowed position, the arm's stowed evaluation should report that correctly
 When the gripper joint is close to its closed position the gripper evaluation should return a closed gripper
 When the gripper joint is close to its open position the gripper evaluation should return a opened gripper
 
 
THERE SHOULD BE A CHNAGE IN THE MAIN SPOT ARM STATUS FILE IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT +-0.2 SPACE FOR GRIPPER VALUES

 ** Add integration test for status publisher
 
** finish Issue 6 Please make sure that your function names are as descriptive as possible. Think about what the function actually does and what function name would represent this.
