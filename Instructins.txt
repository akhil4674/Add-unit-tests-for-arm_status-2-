We should have unit tests verifying that different joint values produce the correct results:

 When the arm's joint values are at the stowed position, the arm's stowed evaluation should report that correctly
 When the arm's joint values are not at the stowed position, the arm's stowed evaluation should report that correctly
 When the gripper joint is close to its closed position the gripper evaluation should return a closed gripper
 When the gripper joint is close to its open position the gripper evaluation should return a opened gripper
